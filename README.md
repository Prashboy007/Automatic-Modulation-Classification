# Automatic-Modulation-Classification
This project involves building a deep learning-based model to classify modulation schemes from wireless communication signals. The input data consists of complex-valued IQ (In-phase and Quadrature) signals, and the model leverages convolutional and recurrent layers to extract spatial and temporal features, enabling accurate classification.
